# Age Progression and Facial Alteration System for Forensic Investigations using GANs

**Siddharth Kamath, Varun S Amin, Vinay Kumar U**

We present a GAN-powered framework designed to aid forensic investigations by addressing critical challenges in image processing. Our approach integrates advanced deep generative models such as HRFAE and Pixel2Style2Pixel (pSp) to perform two key tasks: age progression of facial images and transformation of sketches into photo-realistic images. Leveraging the capabilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and the multi-faceted CelebA dataset, this framework enhances image synthesis for forensic applications, offering tools for improved identity verification and reconstruction of inferior-quality imagery. These advancements significantly contribute to the accuracy and visual presentation of forensic evidence for law enforcement.

**Key Features:**

* **Enhanced Forensic Investigations:** Provides valuable tools for facial reconstruction, suspect identification, and missing person searches.
* **State-of-the-art GANs:** Utilizes the advanced pSp GAN model for high-quality image generation.
* **Accurate Age Progression:** Incorporates HRFAE aging techniques to simulate realistic aging effects.
* **Potential for Case Verification:** Helps law enforcement in verifying evidence and identifying potential suspects.

**Project Goals:**

* Develop a robust and accurate system for generating realistic facial images from sketches.
* Implement effective age progression techniques to simulate aging across different age ranges.
* Evaluate the system's performance on real-world forensic case scenarios.
* Explore potential applications beyond traditional forensic investigations.

**CelebAHQdataset**: [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/badasstechie/celebahq-resized-256x256)

**The above dataset does not contain hand sketched images**

## The **important contribution** of the team is the script to **generate synthetic sketch images** using python and OpenCV. 
The Code for reference is in [scripts/pencil_sketch_create_dataset.py](https://github.com/AkhileshV/Sketch-to-face/blob/master/scripts/pencil_sketch_create_dataset.py)

## Steps to prepare dataset:
    1. Download CelebAHQ dataset
    2. Use the pencil_sketch_create_dataset.py script to generate synthetic sketch images.
    3. Split both images and sketches into train, test and val and create separate folders for individual splits
    4. Replace these paths in the paths_config.py file
